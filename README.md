# Locality

We have a list of locations which we will mark on google maps.

From any given location we must know how far is the nearest marked location.

Q: Find me x near y.

1. Download all locations of interest from multiple sources and Calculate their lattitude and longitudes.
2. Map all the locations on map and take a printout.
3. Calculate the location distance from current locations.
